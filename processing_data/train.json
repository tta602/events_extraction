A comparison of the annual data collected by the Bureau with that compiled by the New America Foundation suggests that while their numbers may differ, their underlying findings are substantially similar. Both the Bureau and New America have observed a general decline in the percentage of civilian fatalities since the high in 2006, with a sharp decrease during the Obama administration. According to the Bureau’s data, the proportion of civilians killed in drone strikes fell from 35 percent in 2008 under President Bush to 9 percent thus far in 2012. Similarly, New America reports that the rate of civilian and unknown casualties decreased from 23 percent in 2008 to 2 percent in 2012. This stands to reason when we consider that the Bureau tends to err on the side of assuming that unidentified dead or individuals of disputed identity are civilians, while New America prefers to accommodate ambiguity by listing \"unknowns\" and only reports a civilian or militant casualty when it is reported by two independent sources.",

Analysis by New America suggests that while only 10 percent of drone strikes target al-Qaeda operatives, approximately 50 percent hit Taliban targets and in 2009, 19 of the first 32 drone strikes targeted the organization of Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban who was ultimately responsible for the deaths of thousands of Pakistanis, and the alleged mastermind of the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Mehsud was a far greater threat to Pakistani security than that of the United States.",

Flackes and Elliott (1994) Northern Ireland: A Political Directory 1968-1993 Many watching the television news reports were reduced to tears by horrifying pictures of firemen and rescue workers ... scraping up the remains of human beings into plastic bags ... Bardon (1992) A History of Ulster 'Bloody Friday' is the name given to the events that occurred in Belfast on Friday 21 July 1972. During the afternoon of 'Bloody Friday' the Irish Republican Army (IRA) planted and <tgr> exploded </tgr> 22 bombs which, in the space of 75 minutes, killed 9 people and seriously injured approximately 130 others. In addition to the bombs there were numerous hoax warnings about other explosive devices which added to the chaos in the streets that afternoon. Many people believe these hoax warnings were deliberately used to reduce the effectiveness of the security forces in dealing with the real bombs. As the quotes above make clear, the killing and maiming had a profound impact on most people in Northern Ireland. 'Bloody Friday' also led to the decision by the British Government to implement 'Operation Motorman' when, in the biggest British military operation since the 1956 Suez crisis, the British Army entered and ended the 'no-go' areas of Belfast and Derry.",

The bombers' original target, The Gem, was associated with the Official IRA. It is claimed that the MRF ordered the team to bomb The Gem, with the intention of blaming it on the Provisional IRA.

However, as The Gem had security outside, they bombed the nearest 'Catholic pub'.",

McVeigh, who had devised the plot to bomb the Murrah Building and had planted the bomb, was sentenced to death. On May 8, 2001, one week before McVeigh's scheduled execution date, the Department of Justice and the FBI revealed to McVeigh's and Nichols' attorneys that over 700 investigative documents had not been disclosed to the defendants before their trials. The government acknowledged that it had violated a discovery order in the case, and the Attorney General stayed McVeigh's execution for one month in order to resolve the legal issues arising from the belated disclosure.

WILLIAM WHITELAW, IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, 24 JULY 1972:- As the House will know, the City and people of Belfast suffered a murderous sequence of explosions last Friday. Most of the 27 explosions in Belfast that day occurred within a 3½ hour period in the afternoon-at a time when, and at places where high civilian casualties must have been expected and intended. No adequate warnings were given. Seven civilians and two soldiers were killed and at least 130 civilians injured-many gravely. I hardly need point out that all sections of the community are indiscriminately affected by these outrages. Of the <tgr> dead </tgr> two were Roman Catholics. Of the 130 injured at least 40 were Roman Catholics. 53 were men and boys, 77 women and children. I am sure the whole House will wish to join with me in expressing sympathy to the families of all those involved in this wanton attack on innocent men, women and children. After the appallingly bloodthirsty and criminal events of last Friday, there cannot be any remaining shred of support for the men who perpetrate them. Even those sectors of Roman Catholic opinion throughout the world which have traditionally identified themselves with and perhaps given the benefit of the doubt to any group of men who claimed to speak for the Irish Republican movement can surely no longer continue to uphold the men who were responsible for Friday's horrible catalogue of slaughter. Supporters of the Republican movement in this country, in Northern Ireland, in the United States and elsewhere, will no doubt notice the revulsion in some circles in the Irish Republic. Since Parliament at the end of March entrusted the Government with complete responsibility for all administration in Northern Ireland, we have made the most patient and reasoned effort to secure the end of violence. No one can deny that Her Majesty's Government have now an absolutely unchallengeable right to ask this House, this country, and indeed the whole world for their support in an absolute determination to destroy the capacity of the IRA for further acts of inhumanity. They have degraded the human race, and it must now be clear to all that their sole object is to promote their aims by violence and by violence alone.",

WILLIAM WHITELAW, IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, 24 JULY 1972:- As the House will know, the City and people of Belfast suffered a murderous sequence of <tgr> explosions </tgr> last Friday. Most of the 27 explosions in Belfast that day occurred within a 3½ hour period in the afternoon-at a time when, and at places where high civilian casualties must have been expected and intended. No adequate warnings were given. Seven civilians and two soldiers were killed and at least 130 civilians injured-many gravely. I hardly need point out that all sections of the community are indiscriminately affected by these outrages. Of the dead two were Roman Catholics. Of the 130 injured at least 40 were Roman Catholics. 53 were men and boys, 77 women and children. I am sure the whole House will wish to join with me in expressing sympathy to the families of all those involved in this wanton attack on innocent men, women and children. After the appallingly bloodthirsty and criminal events of last Friday, there cannot be any remaining shred of support for the men who perpetrate them. Even those sectors of Roman Catholic opinion throughout the world which have traditionally identified themselves with and perhaps given the benefit of the doubt to any group of men who claimed to speak for the Irish Republican movement can surely no longer continue to uphold the men who were responsible for Friday's horrible catalogue of slaughter. Supporters of the Republican movement in this country, in Northern Ireland, in the United States and elsewhere, will no doubt notice the revulsion in some circles in the Irish Republic. Since Parliament at the end of March entrusted the Government with complete responsibility for all administration in Northern Ireland, we have made the most patient and reasoned effort to secure the end of violence. No one can deny that Her Majesty's Government have now an absolutely unchallengeable right to ask this House, this country, and indeed the whole world for their support in an absolute determination to destroy the capacity of the IRA for further acts of inhumanity. They have degraded the human race, and it must now be clear to all that their sole object is to promote their aims by violence and by violence alone.",

    "text": "THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS MADE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND, MR. WILLIAM WHITELAW, IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, 24 JULY 1972:- As the House will know, the City and people of Belfast suffered a murderous sequence of <tgr> explosions </tgr> last Friday. Most of the 27 explosions in Belfast that day occurred within a 3½ hour period in the afternoon-at a time when, and at places where high civilian casualties must have been expected and intended. No adequate warnings were given. Seven civilians and two soldiers were killed and at least 130 civilians injured-many gravely. I hardly need point out that all sections of the community are indiscriminately affected by these outrages. Of the dead two were Roman Catholics. Of the 130 injured at least 40 were Roman Catholics. 53 were men and boys, 77 women and children. I am sure the whole House will wish to join with me in expressing sympathy to the families of all those involved in this wanton attack on innocent men, women and children. After the appallingly bloodthirsty and criminal events of last Friday, there cannot be any remaining shred of support for the men who perpetrate them. Even those sectors of Roman Catholic opinion throughout the world which have traditionally identified themselves with and perhaps given the benefit of the doubt to any group of men who claimed to speak for the Irish Republican movement can surely no longer continue to uphold the men who were responsible for Friday's horrible catalogue of slaughter. Supporters of the Republican movement in this country, in Northern Ireland, in the United States and elsewhere, will no doubt notice the revulsion in some circles in the Irish Republic. Since Parliament at the end of March entrusted the Government with complete responsibility for all administration in Northern Ireland, we have made the most patient and reasoned effort to secure the end of violence. No one can deny that Her Majesty's Government have now an absolutely unchallengeable right to ask this House, this country, and indeed the whole world for their support in an absolute determination to destroy the capacity of the IRA for further acts of inhumanity. They have degraded the human race, and it must now be clear to all that their sole object is to promote their aims by violence and by violence alone.",

It was a hot Saturday morning, the first weekend of Italy’s traditional holiday month, and thousands of vacationers jostled their way to and from the trains in Bologna’s central railroad station.

The suitcase contained over forty pounds of explosives, perhaps stable nitroglycerine, connected to a timer. At exactly 10:25 AM it <tgr> exploded </tgr>, ripping through the crowd, tearing apart the reinforced concrete walls, and bringing the roof crashing down on hundreds of bodies and parts of bodies.",

    "text": "Byline: DON MALHIIRA bombers brought terror to the streets of the West Midlands in the 1970s.Last week republican terrorist Mick Murray was named as a ringleader of the gang behind the <tgr> bombings </tgr> of two pubs in Birmingham city centre on November 21, 1974.The blasts in the Tavern in the Town and the the Mulberry Bush killed 21 innocent people and injured more than 200.Today, on the 30th anniversary of the pub bombings, we look at the other IRA men whobrought terror to the region during that fateful year.Together they were known as the Birmingham Nine and were convicted of carrying out 20 explosions in the run-up to the pub bombings.The nine men were jailed for a total of 260 years.The Birmingham Six - Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker - were jailed for the pub bombings, but later had their convictions quashed.One theory for the blasts is that they were intended to 'commemorate' the death of IRA bomber James McDade.The 28 year-old, described by republicans as a 'Lieutenant of the Birmingham Battalion', accidentally blew himself up while attempting to destroy a Coventry telephone exchange a week before the pub bombings. On the afternoon of November 21, with emotions running high, all police leave was cancelled and an extra 1,300 officers were drafted in to guard his coffin as it was driven to Coventry airport and flown to Ireland.But hours after the funeral procession, two bombs exploded in two packed Birmingham city centre pubs.It has been claimed that a 'link man' ordered the revenge attacks in an impulsive grief-stricken reaction to McDade's death - without the blessing of IRA chiefs in Belfast. The secret figure, whose identity has never been revealed, is believed to have then left for Ireland to attend the funeral and has remained there ever since.Another theory is that the bombings were revenge attacks for the Loyalist Dublin and Monaghan bombings six months earlier.Thirty four people died in the Ulster Volunteer Force attacks, labelled the worst atrocity of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It has been claimed the British security forces colluded with the loyalist terrorists in the bombings.Mick Murray was one of three men arrested along with the Birmingham Six by West Midlands Police in the immediate aftermath of the pub blasts.It has been claimed that Murray, who died in 1999, helped choose the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town as targets.And he was named as being one of the bomb-makers who transported the explosives to the city centre before handing them to the men who planted them.But, it is claimed Murray then botched a telephone warning made to our sister newspaper The Birmingham Post. It was supposed to give half an hour for the pubs to be cleared. But his warning, using the codeword Double X, came just six minutes before the first explosion - and did not name either pub.Murray admitted being a member of the IRA after his arrest. But West Midlands Police never charged him with murder and he served 12 years in jail for conspiracy to cause explosions.In 1990 his name was mentioned in a report handed to the Government by the Who Bombed Birmingham? Granada TV programme.The show was based on a book by campaigning MP, Chris Mullin, who said he met the real bombers, but could not reveal their identity.In another Parliamentary report, the MP stated the programme-makers had also passed a Special Branch document containing details of interviews with an IRAman to the Home Office. The unnamed terrorist had been arrested in November 1975 - six months after the trial and conviction of the Birmingham Six.Mr Mullin claimed the terrorist gave police accurate information including the names of some of those whom he said were responsible for the bombs.Crucially, the papers contained the remark: 'So-and-so told me he put one of the bombs in the pub.'AlongwithMurrayand the Birmingham Six two other men - including James Kelly - were arrested in the immediate aftermath of the carnage.Kelly was found guilty of possessing explosives and bizarrely claimed he was a spy who infiltrated the IRA so he could later give help to the police.The Birmingham Six were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975 for the pub bombings. They were all Belfast born but had lived in Brum since the 1960s.Five of them had left the city on the early evening of November 21 from New Street Station - hours before the explosions - to travel to Belfast to attend McDade's funeral. They were seen off by Callaghan.The five were arrested at Heysham that evening and Callaghan was taken into custody the next day.All the men were interrogated by Birmingham CID and claimed at trial they were beaten, threatened and forced to sign statements written by the police over three days of questioning.Their convictions were overturned by the Court of Appeal in March1991and their case is seen as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history.Terrorist activity was rife in the Midlands during the 1970sand police arrested scores of IRA members in the months following the bombings.But the IRA unit which gained particular notoriety was the Birmingham Nine.

    "text": "Byline: DON MALHIIRA bombers brought terror to the streets of the West Midlands in the 1970s.Last week republican terrorist Mick Murray was named as a ringleader of the gang behind the bombings of two pubs in Birmingham city centre on November 21, 1974.The blasts in the Tavern in the Town and the the Mulberry Bush killed 21 innocent people and injured more than 200.Today, on the 30th anniversary of the pub bombings, we look at the other IRA men whobrought terror to the region during that fateful year.Together they were known as the Birmingham Nine and were convicted of carrying out 20 explosions in the run-up to the pub bombings.The nine men were <tgr> jailed </tgr> for a total of 260 years.The Birmingham Six - Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker - were jailed for the pub bombings, but later had their convictions quashed.One theory for the blasts is that they were intended to 'commemorate' the death of IRA bomber James McDade.The 28 year-old, described by republicans as a 'Lieutenant of the Birmingham Battalion', accidentally blew himself up while attempting to destroy a Coventry telephone exchange a week before the pub bombings. On the afternoon of November 21, with emotions running high, all police leave was cancelled and an extra 1,300 officers were drafted in to guard his coffin as it was driven to Coventry airport and flown to Ireland.But hours after the funeral procession, two bombs exploded in two packed Birmingham city centre pubs.It has been claimed that a 'link man' ordered the revenge attacks in an impulsive grief-stricken reaction to McDade's death - without the blessing of IRA chiefs in Belfast. The secret figure, whose identity has never been revealed, is believed to have then left for Ireland to attend the funeral and has remained there ever since.Another theory is that the bombings were revenge attacks for the Loyalist Dublin and Monaghan bombings six months earlier.Thirty four people died in the Ulster Volunteer Force attacks, labelled the worst atrocity of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It has been claimed the British security forces colluded with the loyalist terrorists in the bombings.Mick Murray was one of three men arrested along with the Birmingham Six by West Midlands Police in the immediate aftermath of the pub blasts.It has been claimed that Murray, who died in 1999, helped choose the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town as targets.And he was named as being one of the bomb-makers who transported the explosives to the city centre before handing them to the men who planted them.But, it is claimed Murray then botched a telephone warning made to our sister newspaper The Birmingham Post. It was supposed to give half an hour for the pubs to be cleared. But his warning, using the codeword Double X, came just six minutes before the first explosion - and did not name either pub.Murray admitted being a member of the IRA after his arrest. But West Midlands Police never charged him with murder and he served 12 years in jail for conspiracy to cause explosions.In 1990 his name was mentioned in a report handed to the Government by the Who Bombed Birmingham? Granada TV programme.The show was based on a book by campaigning MP, Chris Mullin, who said he met the real bombers, but could not reveal their identity.In another Parliamentary report, the MP stated the programme-makers had also passed a Special Branch document containing details of interviews with an IRAman to the Home Office. The unnamed terrorist had been arrested in November 1975 - six months after the trial and conviction of the Birmingham Six.Mr Mullin claimed the terrorist gave police accurate information including the names of some of those whom he said were responsible for the bombs.Crucially, the papers contained the remark: 'So-and-so told me he put one of the bombs in the pub.'AlongwithMurrayand the Birmingham Six two other men - including James Kelly - were arrested in the immediate aftermath of the carnage.Kelly was found guilty of possessing explosives and bizarrely claimed he was a spy who infiltrated the IRA so he could later give help to the police.The Birmingham Six were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975 for the pub bombings. They were all Belfast born but had lived in Brum since the 1960s.Five of them had left the city on the early evening of November 21 from New Street Station - hours before the explosions - to travel to Belfast to attend McDade's funeral. They were seen off by Callaghan.The five were arrested at Heysham that evening and Callaghan was taken into custody the next day.All the men were interrogated by Birmingham CID and claimed at trial they were beaten, threatened and forced to sign statements written by the police over three days of questioning.Their convictions were overturned by the Court of Appeal in March1991and their case is seen as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history.Terrorist activity was rife in the Midlands during the 1970sand police arrested scores of IRA members in the months following the bombings.But the IRA unit which gained particular notoriety was the Birmingham Nine. They were responsible for 20 of the 31 bomb blasts in Birmingham and parts of the West Midlands between August 1973 and August 1974.Patrick Guilfoyle, Martin Coughlan, Gerard Young, Joseph Duffy, Michael Murray, Anthony Madigan, Joseph Ashe, Gerald Small and Stephen Blake conducted the biggest wave of bombings in the region since the Second World War.Coughlan and Young were said to be the leading figures in the campaign.Coughlan was born in Dublin and came to Birmingham in 1956.

    "text": "Byline: DON MALHIIRA bombers brought terror to the streets of the West Midlands in the 1970s.Last week republican terrorist Mick Murray was named as a ringleader of the gang behind the bombings of two pubs in Birmingham city centre on November 21, 1974.The blasts in the Tavern in the Town and the the Mulberry Bush killed 21 innocent people and injured more than 200.Today, on the 30th anniversary of the pub bombings, we look at the other IRA men whobrought terror to the region during that fateful year.Together they were known as the Birmingham Nine and were convicted of carrying out 20 explosions in the run-up to the pub bombings.The nine men were jailed for a total of 260 years.The Birmingham Six - Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker - were jailed for the pub bombings, but later had their <tgr> conviction </tgr>s quashed.One theory for the blasts is that they were intended to 'commemorate' the death of IRA bomber James McDade.The 28 year-old, described by republicans as a 'Lieutenant of the Birmingham Battalion', accidentally blew himself up while attempting to destroy a Coventry telephone exchange a week before the pub bombings. On the afternoon of November 21, with emotions running high, all police leave was cancelled and an extra 1,300 officers were drafted in to guard his coffin as it was driven to Coventry airport and flown to Ireland.But hours after the funeral procession, two bombs exploded in two packed Birmingham city centre pubs.It has been claimed that a 'link man' ordered the revenge attacks in an impulsive grief-stricken reaction to McDade's death - without the blessing of IRA chiefs in Belfast. The secret figure, whose identity has never been revealed, is believed to have then left for Ireland to attend the funeral and has remained there ever since.Another theory is that the bombings were revenge attacks for the Loyalist Dublin and Monaghan bombings six months earlier.Thirty four people died in the Ulster Volunteer Force attacks, labelled the worst atrocity of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It has been claimed the British security forces colluded with the loyalist terrorists in the bombings.Mick Murray was one of three men arrested along with the Birmingham Six by West Midlands Police in the immediate aftermath of the pub blasts.It has been claimed that Murray, who died in 1999, helped choose the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town as targets.And he was named as being one of the bomb-makers who transported the explosives to the city centre before handing them to the men who planted them.But, it is claimed Murray then botched a telephone warning made to our sister newspaper The Birmingham Post. It was supposed to give half an hour for the pubs to be cleared. But his warning, using the codeword Double X, came just six minutes before the first explosion - and did not name either pub.Murray admitted being a member of the IRA after his arrest.

The secret figure, whose identity has never been revealed, is believed to have then left for Ireland to attend the funeral and has remained there ever since.Another theory is that the bombings were revenge attacks for the Loyalist Dublin and Monaghan bombings six months earlier.Thirty four people died in the Ulster Volunteer Force attacks, labelled the worst atrocity of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It has been claimed the British security forces colluded with the loyalist terrorists in the bombings.Mick Murray was one of three men arrested along with the Birmingham Six by West Midlands Police in the immediate aftermath of the pub blasts.It has been claimed that Murray, who died in 1999, helped choose the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town as targets.And he was named as being one of the bomb-makers who transported the explosives to the city centre before handing them to the men who planted them.But, it is claimed Murray then botched a telephone warning made to our sister newspaper The Birmingham Post. It was supposed to give half an hour for the pubs to be cleared. But his warning, using the codeword Double X, came just six minutes before the first explosion - and did not name either pub.Murray admitted being a member of the IRA after his arrest. But West Midlands Police never charged him with murder and he served 12 years in jail for conspiracy to cause explosions.In 1990 his name was mentioned in a report handed to the Government by the Who Bombed Birmingham? Granada TV programme.The show was based on a book by campaigning MP, Chris Mullin, who said he met the real bombers, but could not reveal their identity.In another Parliamentary report, the MP stated the programme-makers had also passed a Special Branch document containing details of interviews with an IRAman to the Home Office. The unnamed terrorist had been arrested in November 1975 - six months after the trial and conviction of the Birmingham Six.Mr Mullin claimed the terrorist gave police accurate information including the names of some of those whom he said were responsible for the bombs.Crucially, the papers contained the remark: 'So-and-so told me he put one of the bombs in the pub.'AlongwithMurrayand the Birmingham Six two other men - including James Kelly - were arrested in the immediate aftermath of the carnage.Kelly was found guilty of possessing explosives and bizarrely claimed he was a spy who infiltrated the IRA so he could later give help to the police.The Birmingham Six were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975 for the pub bombings. They were all Belfast born but had lived in Brum since the 1960s.Five of them had left the city on the early evening of November 21 from New Street Station - hours before the explosions - to travel to Belfast to attend McDade's funeral. They were seen off by Callaghan.The five were arrested at Heysham that evening and Callaghan was taken into custody the next day.All the men were interrogated by Birmingham CID and claimed at trial they were beaten, threatened and forced to sign statements written by the police over three days of questioning.Their convictions were overturned by the Court of Appeal in March1991and their case is seen as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history.Terrorist activity was rife in the Midlands during the 1970sand police arrested scores of IRA members in the months following the bombings.But the IRA unit which gained particular notoriety was the Birmingham Nine. They were responsible for 20 of the 31 bomb blasts in Birmingham and parts of the West Midlands between August 1973 and August 1974.Patrick Guilfoyle, Martin Coughlan, Gerard Young, Joseph Duffy, Michael Murray, Anthony Madigan, Joseph Ashe, Gerald Small and Stephen Blake conducted the biggest wave of bombings in the region since the Second World War.Coughlan and Young were said to be the leading figures in the campaign.Coughlan was born in Dublin and came to Birmingham in 1956. He rented a house in Chelmsley Wood with his wife and had three children.It is believed he was the brains behind the campaign of terror which began in Birmingham and spread to Manchester.Guilfoyle never quite made the grade of bomber. He caused an explosion that badly injured one of his IRA colleagues because he was smoking a cigarette while making a bomb.Northern Ireland historian David McVea said: 'Many different theories have been put forward as to who actually carried out the bombings, but it is unlikely that the true culprits will ever be identified.'The IRA was very protective of its members at the time, people moved in and out of the different cells constantly. 'As well as the killing of so many innocent people the real tragedy is the wrongful jailing of the Birmingham Six.'The IRA was able to use the injustice against these men to their advantage for years.'CAPTION(S):SLAUGHTERED: victims are taken away from the pub bombings; DEVASTATED: wreckage outside the Tavern in the Town; DEAD: James McDade; TRIBUTE: memorial to the victims",
